These implementations are mostly based on

* Christer Ericson: Real-Time Collision Detection, CRC Press, 2004.
* David H. Eberly: 3D Game Engine Design, CRC Press, 2006.

and accompanying implementations. These are marked as such.

The distance computation between a line and a circle is based on David Eberly's
implementation, Copyright (c) 1998-2022 David Eberly, Geometric Tools,

The GJK algorithm is a translation to Python of the translation to C of the
original Fortran implementation. The C implementation is from Diego Ruspini.
It is available from http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/files/gilbert.c

Some features related to the GJK algorithm have been inspired by
Bullet (https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/, zlib license) and are
marked as such in the source code.

The EPA algorithm is adapted from Kevin Moran's GJK implementation
(https://github.com/kevinmoran/GJK, MIT License or Unlicense).

The GJK intersection test and MPR algorithm are based on libccd (for details,
see https://github.com/danfis/libccd). For the original code the copyright is

The translation to Python has been done by Alexander Fabisch and the glue
